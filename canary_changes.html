iTerm2 1.0.0.20111219
You'd better sit down for this one.

Marquee Features
- Deep tmux integration!
   Have you ever had an ssh session lost because you had to reboot, had a network failure, or the power went out? Are you tired of giving up a keystroke to tmux or screen? Suffer no longer! iTerm2 and tmux are now deeply integrated. By installing a special version of tmux, it gains the ability to speak directly to iTerm2. When you run tmux with -C, iTerm2 will open real, native windows or tabs for each tmux window. The whole state of your tmux session is reflected in native iTerm2 windows. As you interact with a window, your typing is sent back to tmux. Any time you resize a window, add a split pane, close a split pane, close a window, or open a window (with Shell->tmux->new window), that action happens in tmux as well as in iTerm2.
